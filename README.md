🚀 CryptoBud - Proprietary Cryptocurrency Intelligence Platform
============================================================
Welcome! I'm your AI crypto assistant with real-time data.
Ask me about prices, sustainability, or general crypto questions.
Type 'quit' to exit.

You: What's Bitcoin's price?
CryptoBud: 💰 BTC is currently trading at $43,250.00 (24h change: +2.4%). 
Remember, crypto prices are highly volatile!

You: Compare Ethereum vs Cardano sustainability
CryptoBud: 🌱 Ethereum has a sustainability score of 8/10 with 0.0026 kWh per 
transaction after transitioning to Proof of Stake. Cardano scores 9/10 with 
0.0015 kWh per transaction, making it slightly more eco-friendly.

You: What's 25 * 4?
CryptoBud: 🧮 25 * 4 = 100. Speaking of calculations, I can also help you 
calculate crypto profits and portfolio values!
```

## 🤖 How CryptoBud Mimics AI Decision-Making

CryptoBud demonstrates sophisticated AI decision-making through multiple layers of intelligent processing:

**Pattern Recognition**: The system analyzes market data patterns using statistical algorithms to identify trends, similar to how neural networks recognize patterns in data.

**If-Else Logic Trees**: Complex decision trees evaluate multiple factors (market cap, volatility, sustainability scores) to generate investment recommendations, mimicking how AI systems process multiple inputs.

**Natural Language Understanding**: Using ChatterBot and custom NLP, the system interprets user queries contextually, demonstrating language comprehension capabilities found in advanced AI.

**Adaptive Responses**: The bot learns from conversation patterns and adjusts responses based on query complexity and user intent, showing adaptive behavior characteristic of machine learning systems.

**Multi-Factor Analysis**: Like AI systems, CryptoBud weighs multiple variables simultaneously (price trends, market sentiment, environmental impact) to make informed decisions rather than relying on single data points.
